# HI-LO-ALL-07-Programmer-Adapters
Reverse engineered programming adapters for the ALL-07 Programmer

The purpose of this repository is to find, and redesign programming adapters for the ALL-03, ALL-07, and ALL-11 device programmers from HI-LO Systems.  Owners of such devices adapters are encouraged to provide schematics, or to "lend" devices for the purpose of creating schematics which can then be used to redesign these boards.

The reason such a project is needed is that these are very capable programmers for a multitude of older devices.  And with the clones of the programming adapters being made available, or the gerbers to create one's own, this gives owners of these programmers more reach in their ability to repair and work on legacy systems.

Currently looking for schematics for any adapters for the HI-LO systems programmers, or their "PAC" adapters: PAC-DIP48, PAC-DIP40, etc.  However, the ADP-EPM7128E-PL or ADP-EMP7128-PL is high up on the priority list.
